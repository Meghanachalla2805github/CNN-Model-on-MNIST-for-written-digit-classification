# CNN Model for MNIST Digit Classification
This repository features a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model implemented in Tensorflow and keras.This model is trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits accurately

# MNIST CLASSIFICATION
# Dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is widely-used dataset for tarining and evaluting image processing systems.It contains a large collection of handwritten digit images, including a training set of 60,000 grayscale images, each sized at 28x28 pixels, representing the digit 0 to 9, and a test set of 10,000 images. This digits are a subset of a more extensive set provided by NIST, and have been preprocessed to be size-normalized and centered within a fixed-size image.
